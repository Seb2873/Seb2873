### Hi! 👋
<br>
I’m currently working on my small ball-rolling game created with the Unity game engine. 
It's not much, but I look forward to finishing it. It's my first "real" game.

My main focus right now is to develop a few skills. I would like to get better at: game development 🎮, programming 🧑‍💻, video editing 🎥,
audio editing 🎧, creating music 🎹, 3D modelling 🧊, and photo editing 📸.

I'd like to collaborate with others to create a video game because I know it's a great learning experience.
I plan on entering a game jam team soon...

I enjoy learning and trying new things, but I also like to play card/board games 🎲🃏 and take walks outside 🌳.
<br>

Thanks for taking the time to read this... Have a nice day 😀
